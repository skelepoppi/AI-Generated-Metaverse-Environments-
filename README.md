# PromptSpace: AI-Generated Metaverse Environments (Stacks Edition)

**PromptSpace** is a decentralized platform built on the **Stacks blockchain** that allows users to generate, own, and monetize high-fidelity 3D virtual environments using simple AI prompts. By leveraging Stacks, PromptSpace inherits the security of Bitcoin while enabling expressive smart contracts through Clarity.

## 🚀 Overview
PromptSpace bridges the gap between Generative AI and the Metaverse. By utilizing state-of-the-art 3D generative models and the Stacks blockchain, it enables anyone to become a virtual world-builder without needing complex design skills, with all ownership secured by Bitcoin.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Prompt-to-World Engine**: Generate 3D landscapes, interiors, and lighting setups from text or voice commands.
- **Stacks NFT Ownership**: Every generated environment is minted as a unique NFT using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks mainnet.
- **Bitcoin Security**: Benefit from the security and settlement of the Bitcoin network via Stacks' Proof-of-Transfer (PoX).
- **Dynamic AI Assets**: Real-time generation of 3D objects and furniture to populate your space.
- **Interoperability**: Export environments in standard `glTF` and `GLB` formats for use in existing Metaverse platforms or custom VR apps.
- **AI-Powered NPCs**: Integrate smart, interactive guides into your spaces using LLM-driven behaviors.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Blockchain**:
  - **Stacks**: Layer 2 for Bitcoin, providing smart contract functionality.
  - **Clarity**: Decidable smart contracts for secure NFT (SIP-009) minting and ownership.
  - **Hiro SDK**: For seamless integration with Stacks accounts and transactions.
- **AI Models**:
