# PromptSpace: AI-Generated Metaverse Environments

**PromptSpace** is a decentralized platform that allows users to generate, own, and monetize high-fidelity 3D virtual environments using simple AI prompts. 

## 🚀 Overview
PromptSpace bridges the gap between Generative AI and the Metaverse. By utilizing state-of-the-art 3D generative models and blockchain technology, it enables anyone to become a virtual world-builder without needing complex design skills.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Prompt-to-World Engine**: Generate 3D landscapes, interiors, and lighting setups from text or voice commands.
- **NFT Ownership**: Every generated environment is minted as a unique NFT on a low-fee Layer 2 blockchain (e.g., Polygon).
- **Dynamic AI Assets**: Real-time generation of 3D objects and furniture to populate your space.
- **Interoperability**: Export environments in standard `glTF` and `GLB` formats for use in existing Metaverse platforms like Decentraland or custom VR apps.
- **AI-Powered NPCs**: Integrate smart, interactive guides into your spaces using LLM-driven behaviors.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **AI Models**:
  - `Skybox AI`: For 360-degree environment generation.
  - `Shap-E` / `Point-E`: For text-to-3D object generation.
  - `Stable Diffusion`: For high-quality texture mapping.
- **Blockchain**:
  - `Solidity`: Smart contracts for ERC-721/1155 ownership.
  - `Polygon / Arbitrum`: Scalable infrastructure for minting.
- **Frontend & Rendering**:
  - `Three.js` / `Babylon.js`: Web-based 3D engine.
  - `React`: User interface and interaction.
- **Decentralized Storage**:
  - `IPFS`: For hosting 3D assets and metadata.

## 📈 Use Cases
- **Virtual Art Galleries**: Host and display NFT collections in a custom-generated space.
- **Immersive Meetings**: Create unique, themed offices for remote team collaboration.
- **Personal Social Hubs**: Private digital spaces for hangouts, gaming, and media sharing.
- **Brand Showcases**: Rapidly deploy virtual pop-up shops and interactive experiences.

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- [ ] Phase 1: Core AI engine integration and basic 3D viewer.
- [ ] Phase 2: Smart contract deployment and NFT minting functionality.
- [ ] Phase 3: Marketplace for AI-generated assets and environments.
- [ ] Phase 4: Interoperability bridges for major Metaverse platforms.
